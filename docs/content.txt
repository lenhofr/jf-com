Built the Hard Way. Ready to Fight for You.
I’m Jesse Foreman, and I’m running for Kentucky State Representative in the 69th District because I know firsthand what it means to work hard, take risks, and fight through adversity to build a better life.

Nothing I’ve earned came easy. I wasn’t handed success — I built it through long hours, tough decisions, personal sacrifice, and perseverance. Like so many families in Northern Kentucky, I’ve lived the reality of balancing work, family, and responsibility — and I believe government should reflect those same values.







A Business Mindset for Government
In business, results matter. Accountability matters.
That’s the mindset we need representing our district and I’ll bring it to Frankfort.

I will fight for fiscal responsibility and a government that lives within its means.

I’ll stand up for small businesses, job creators, and working families — not bureaucrats and lifelong politicians. 

I believe government should get out of the way, not stand in it. I believe regulations are often a restraint on freedom. 

Effectiveness in passing meaningful legislation is the measure voters should use to determine who should represent our district in Frankfort. 


Putting Families First
Family is everything. It’s why we work, why we sacrifice, and why we care about the future.

I will defend life and stand for Kentucky's values.

I’ll support strengthening our school systems and making sure our children are prepared for their future and are financially savvy 

I will always protect our constitutional freedoms, including the Second Amendment.




Safe Communities, Strong Values
A strong community starts with safety, respect for the law, and personal responsibility.

I support our law enforcement officers and first responders.

I’ll fight for policies that keep our neighborhoods safe.

I believe accountability applies to everyone, including government.

I'll stand up for our community members with mental health conditions and support legislation that gets them the help they need. 



A Representative Who Understands Real Life
I don’t come from politics, I come from real life. I have worked hard, failed, learned, and succeeded.  I understand what it’s like to:

Take responsibility when things go wrong

Earn trust through action and not talk

No matter how many times you get knocked down, you get back up and keep fighting.  

That experience matters, and it’s exactly what Frankfort needs.



A Fighter for the 69th District
The 69th District is built on hard work, faith, family, and community.
I’m ready to fight for those values, every single day, as your voice in Frankfort.

I’m Jesse Foreman.
I’ve fought for everything I have earned in life, and now I’m ready to fight for you.

Vote Republican.
Vote Jesse Foreman for State Representative, 69th District.
